# HelloSwift CLI

A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application in Swift that greets the user with a "Hello, Swift!" message.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Swift compiler installed on your system. You can check the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
swift --version
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hello-swift-cli
```

Build the source code:

```bash
swift build -c release
```

This will create an executable in the .build folder within the project directory.

Run the executable:

```bash
./.build/release/HelloSwift
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Hello, Swift!
```
